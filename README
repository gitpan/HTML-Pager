NAME

HTML::Pager - Perl module to handle CGI HTML paging of arbitary data

DESCRIPTION 

This module handles the paging of data coming from an arbitrary source
and being displayed using HTML::Template and CGI.pm.  It
provides an interface to pages of data similar to many well-known
sites, like altavista.digital.com or www.google.com.

This module uses HTML::Templateto do all its HTML
generation.  While it is possible to use this module without directly
using HTML::Template, it's not very useful.  Modification
of the look-and-feel as well as the functionality of the resulting
HTML should all be done through HTML::Template objects.  Take a look
at the the HTML::Template perldocs for more info.

This module is licenced under the GPL.  See the LICENSE section
below for more details.

DOCUMENTATION 

Please see the perldocs for documentation.  It's much more up-to-date
and informative than this README!
